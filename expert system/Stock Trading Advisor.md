# 📈 Project Idea: A Stock Trading Advisor Expert System

> *"Turning Predictive Models into Actionable Financial Advice"*

---

## 🎯 **Project Goal**

Create an **expert system** that integrates the output of an LSTM-based stock price predictor with rule-based logic to deliver simple, actionable trading recommendations:  
➡️ **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**.

This system bridges the gap between machine learning predictions and real-world decision-making, simulating how a financial analyst might interpret data.

---

## 🔧 How It Works: The System Architecture

The expert system operates in three core stages:

1. **Prediction Engine** – An LSTM model forecasts tomorrow’s closing price.
2. **Knowledge Base** – A set of human-readable, finance-inspired rules.
3. **Inference Engine** – Applies rules to generate a final recommendation.

Together, they form a complete **AI-driven advisory pipeline**.

---

## 1️⃣ The LSTM Model: The "Prediction Engine"

🧠 *The brain of the system — learns patterns from historical data.*

### 🔍 Input:
- Last `n` days of closing prices (e.g., 60 days).
- Optionally: volume, OHLC data, or technical features.

### 🧪 Output:
- Predicted closing price for the **next trading day**.

### ⚙️ Implementation Notes:
- Use Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Normalize data (e.g., MinMaxScaler).
- Train on historical stock data (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage API, etc.).

> ✅ *Tip:* Save your trained model (`model.h5` or `.pkl`) for reuse in the expert system.

---

## 2️⃣ The Knowledge Base: The "Rules of Thumb"

📘 *A curated set of IF-THEN rules inspired by technical analysis and model behavior.*

These rules mimic simplified decision-making logic used by traders, combining **LSTM predictions** with **technical indicators**.

### 📊 Required Technical Indicators

| Indicator | Description | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **SMA (50-day)** | Simple Moving Average over 50 days | Identify trend direction |
| **RSI (14-day)** | Relative Strength Index (0–100) | Detect overbought/oversold conditions |

> 💡 You can compute these using `pandas` or the `ta` library:
```python
import ta
df['sma_50'] = df['close'].rolling(50).mean()
df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(df['close']).rsi()
```

---

### 🧩 Example IF-THEN Rules

Each rule combines **model prediction** and **market context**.

| Condition | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| `LSTM Predicted Price > Current Price` AND `Current Price > SMA_50` | ✅ **Buy** | Uptrend confirmed; model expects rise |
| `LSTM Predicted Price < Current Price` AND `Current Price < SMA_50` | ❌ **Sell** | Downtrend confirmed; model expects drop |
| `RSI > 70` AND `LSTM Predicted Price < Current Price` | ❌ **Sell** | Overbought + bearish prediction |
| `RSI < 30` AND `LSTM Predicted Price > Current Price` | ✅ **Buy** | Oversold + bullish prediction |
| *None of the above apply* | ⏸️ **Hold** | Insufficient signal; wait and watch |

---

### 🔄 Rule Evaluation Priority

To avoid conflicting outputs, evaluate rules in **priority order**:

```python
if rsi > 70 and predicted_price < current_price:
    return "Sell (Overbought & Bearish)"

elif rsi < 30 and predicted_price > current_price:
    return "Buy (Oversold & Bullish)"

elif predicted_price > current_price and current_price > sma_50:
    return "Buy (Uptrend Momentum)"

elif predicted_price < current_price and current_price < sma_50:
    return "Sell (Downtrend Momentum)"

else:
    return "Hold (No Clear Signal)"
```

> [What I Think:]  
> 🔹 **Adding explanation strings** (like in the code above) makes the system **transparent and trustworthy** — crucial for real-world use.  
> 🔹 Consider logging which rule triggered the decision — this enables **auditability and model debugging**.

---

## 3️⃣ The Inference Engine: The "Decision-Maker"

⚙️ *Applies rules to facts and produces a final verdict.*

### 🧠 How It Works:
1. Gathers current facts:
   - `current_price`
   - `sma_50`, `rsi`
   - `lstm_predicted_price`
2. Evaluates rules in sequence.
3. Returns recommendation + explanation.

### 🧪 Pseudocode:
```python
def make_recommendation(current_price, predicted_price, sma_50, rsi):
    if rsi > 70 and predicted_price < current_price:
        return "Sell", "Stock is overbought (RSI > 70) and model predicts decline."
    elif rsi < 30 and predicted_price > current_price:
        return "Buy", "Stock is oversold (RSI < 30) and model predicts rebound."
    elif predicted_price > current_price and current_price > sma_50:
        return "Buy", "Price above 50-day SMA with bullish prediction."
    elif predicted_price < current_price and current_price < sma_50:
        return "Sell", "Price below 50-day SMA with bearish prediction."
    else:
        return "Hold", "No strong signal detected. Wait for clearer trends."
```

> [What I Think:]  
> ✅ This modular design makes it easy to **test, debug, and improve**.  
> 🛠️ You could later expand this into a **rule engine** using libraries like `durable_rules` or `pyknow`, but for now, `if-elif` is perfect.

## 🚶‍♂️ A Simple Walkthrough

Let’s simulate a real run:

1. **Fetch Data**: Get last 60 days of Apple (AAPL) stock prices.
2. **Compute Indicators**:
   - SMA(50) = $189.40
   - RSI(14) = 72
   - Current Price = $190.10
3. **Run LSTM Prediction**:
   - Predicted Price = $188.50
4. **Apply Rules**:
   - RSI > 70 ✅
   - Predicted price < current ✅
   → **Trigger Rule 3**
5. **Output**:
   ```
   Recommendation: Sell
   Reason: Stock is overbought (RSI = 72) and model predicts a drop.
   ```

🎯 Clear, explainable, and actionable.

## ✅ Why This Project Stands Out

| Benefit | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Not Overly Complex** | Uses simple `if-else` logic — ideal for learning expert systems. |
| **End-to-End Solution** | Combines ML + decision logic → more than just a model. |
| **Explainable AI** | Provides **reasons** for decisions — key for finance and ethics. |
| **Extensible** | Easy to add new rules, indicators (MACD, Bollinger Bands), or even sentiment data. |
| **Demonstrates Value** | Shows how your LSTM model **directly impacts decisions**. |

> [What I Think:]  
> 🔥 This project hits a **sweet spot** between technical depth and practical application.  
> 📚 It's perfect for a **final-year project** because it demonstrates:
> - Data preprocessing
> - Deep learning (LSTM)
> - Financial domain knowledge
> - Rule-based systems
> - System integration
> - Interpretability

## 🌟 Suggested Enhancements (Future Work)

> [What I Think:]  
> Here are some **optional but impressive** upgrades you can consider later:

### 📈 Advanced Indicators
- Add **MACD**, **Bollinger Bands**, or **Volume Oscillators**.
- Use the `ta` library to automate calculations.

### 🌐 Real-Time Data
- Integrate with **Yahoo Finance API** or **Alpha Vantage** for live data.
- Schedule daily runs with `cron` or `Airflow`.

### 💬 Natural Language Explanations
- Generate richer summaries:
  > "AAPL is showing signs of exhaustion after a strong rally, with RSI at 72 and our model forecasting a pullback. Consider taking profits."

### 📊 Dashboard (Bonus!)
- Build a simple **Streamlit** or **Flask** web interface.
- Display chart, indicators, prediction, and recommendation.

### 🧪 Backtesting Module
- Simulate past performance of your rules.
- Calculate win rate, profit factor, Sharpe ratio.
