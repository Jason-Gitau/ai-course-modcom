## MACHINE LEARNING
This is basically teaching machines parterns to amke predictions

**TYPE OF ML**
  1. **supervised** - machine learns from labelled data , (recommendation systems)
  2. **unsupervised** - machines learn with unlabbelled data, it finds patters
  3. **reignforcement** - machines learn thru rewayds and penalties (autonomous systems)
     
**DATA TYPES OF ML**
  1. STRUCTURED/UNSTRUCTURED- **structured** data is in tabular form, eg sqll tables,excel sheets,// **unstructured** data requires processing eg emails
  2. NUMERICAL VS CATEGARICAL - **Numerical** are quantitative , can be measured in age  , it is devided into: a)continous b) discrete
                                **categorical** aso know as qualitative, describe objects that cannot be counted or measured easily, using numbers, therefore finite it is subjected to nominal gender
     **ordinal** a natural order of something
  3. timeseries and text data - time series, data indexed after some time

**MODELS IN MACHINE LEARNING**
  1. classification
  2. regression
     unsupervised learning
  4. dimentionality reduction
  5. interplatabity
  6. timeseries data
  7. data 
  8. eda
  9. data cleaning
  10. feature enginering
  11. model selections
  12. model training
  13. evaluation
  14. iteration
  15. deployment
